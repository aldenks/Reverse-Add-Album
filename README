Reverse Album Opener

Usage: rev_add_album.sh [directory]

Open all music files in a dir in reverse alphabetical order.
If filenames begin with the track number, albums opened
  with this tool will be ordered in your music library so you 
  may listen to the album in order if your playlist is sorted 
  newest on top.

Only tested on Mac OSX Lion with iTunes so far.
